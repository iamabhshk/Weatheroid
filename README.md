# Weatheroid

Hey 
Today I am exhilarated to share you my real-time weather website "Weatheroid" where you can search any city and get the weather details. I developed this using pure JavaScript and fetch APIs. Well I had a hard time finding a perfect API for this project though :)

In this website you can find all the neccassary weather details of a particular city in a single page without going to multiple pages, also with a very clean and readable UI.

While working on this project I faced many bugs which made me learn new techniques of making a webite more user freindly. It also made me more aware of the functionality and probable bugs while working for future projects. 

Do star this repository if you liked the webiste :)
